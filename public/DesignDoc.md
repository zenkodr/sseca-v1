### New Life

Citizens start on Earth, enlisting with SSF or corporations. Choose a career path, complete training, and progress through enlistment terms. Acquire ships, land, and major items as NFTs, tradeable on the Galactic market. Exploration leads to staking claims for mining, farming, and development.

### Exploration

Explore and colonize planets as a pathfinder or take on contract missions. Encounter other citizens, pirates, and alien species. Captain or crew deep-space ships, discover celestial and terrestrial assets, and stake claims for resource development.

### Your Empire

Exploration unveils profitable opportunities. Discover faster Celestial Star Paths, trade resources, and build your wealth. From trading raw materials to crafting ship components, SSECA offers diverse career paths. The game's foundation lies in exploration, colonization, and resource development.
