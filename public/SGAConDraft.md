## Article III: Treasury Establishment and Governance

## 3.0 Purpose of the Treasury
The Treasury serves as a central pool of funds collectively governed by multi-signature mechanisms. 

### 3.1.1 Resource Allocation

- Funds are strategically channeled into selected development projects, ecosystem initiatives, and community proposals that align with the SGA DAO's values and objectives. Allocation decisions consider projected returns across various time horizons with a balance of fiscal diligence and enriching experiences.

### 3.1.2 Financial Security

- A portion of Treasury assets remain set aside as a reserve fund to hedge against unexpected expenses, market fluctuations, or emergency initiatives requiring rapid response. Reserve allocation percentages are governed by the Citizen Assembly and tuned based on rolling horizon forecasts.

### 3.1.3 Community Initiatives

- The Treasury dedicates a Development Fund allocation toward financing community-originated proposals and campaigns. This promotes decentralized participation and idea flow. All citizens can submit proposals for DAO funding through an easy application process. Competitively compelling ideas earning sufficient engagement then qualify for collaborative drafting support in structuring executable implementation plans reviewed by the Treasury Council.

### 3.1.4 Executive Oversight

- Oversight of Treasury operations, asset management, and allocation rhythms falls upon the Treasury Council - consisting of highly qualified economists, game theorists, developers, architects and Citizens elected by the majority vote of Citizen Assembly. The Council provides checks and balances on sustainable fund diligence across market cycles in alignment with collective interests.ing.

## 3.2 Treasury Structure
The Treasury shall instantiate as an independently governed entity with robust security protocols:

### 3.2.1 Multi-Signature Fund
- A decentralized 9 of 15 multi-signature scheme shall authorize all Treasury transactions. This distributes authority across enough holders to ensure integrity while avoiding single points of failure.

- Multi-sig holders require unanimous Citizens Assembly approval based on strict criteria. The Assembly maintains power to revoke compromised or non-performing holders after fair hearings.

### 3.2.2 Key Holders
- Multi-signature holders get appointed from a diverse mix of standing Citizens Assembly members, Galactic Tribunal justices, subject matter experts, and rotating community representatives.

- This balances continuity with fresh perspectives to prevent ossification or narrow interests from dominating funds.

### 3.2.3 Funds Governance
- Usage of Treasury funds strictly adheres to the participatory governance processes outlined in this Constitution, with no self-authorization powers. Key stakeholders must submit public proposals justifying resource requests to be competitively evaluated on merits and impact potential.

## 3.3 Funding Sources for the Treasury

The Treasury shall accumulate a diversified portfolio of sustainable funding sources, including:

### 3.3.1 Citizenship Fees
- A fixed percentage of all Certificate of Citizenship issuance and renewal fees gets routed into the Treasury's coffers. As the citizenry expands, so too does this funding base.

- Citizenship fees remain affordable to ensure inclusive access while adequately supporting oversight operations. Dynamic pricing responds to fluctuating Treasury capital requirements.

### 3.3.2 Protocol Revenue Share
- 15% of all revenues derived from activities related to the core protocol like transaction fees, licenses, assets, data sales, partnerships, etc. shall route directly into the Treasury.

- As protocol utility and adoption increases, the contributed portion funds expanded governance capacities.

### 3.3.3 Public Crowdfunding
- The Treasury develops incubated crowdfunding campaigns for subsidizing specific programs like public infrastructure, social support projects, and knowledge repositories.

- Citizens voluntarily pooling resources to fund causes aligned with community values stimulates engaged participation and funding awareness. The Treasury provides aggregation services.

## 3.4 Decision-Making Process
A transparent, participatory process shall govern all Treasury funding decisions:

### 3.4.1 Proposal Submission
- Any citizens or working groups may submit funding proposals by detailing:
  - Intended program to allocate funds towards
  - Specific amount requested
  - Proposed milestones and performance metrics
  - Line-item budget justification

### 3.4.2 Community Review
- Submitted proposals undergo 3 week public review where citizens analyze merits, provide input, raise concerns, and suggest modifications.

- Review findings get aggregated and returned to proposers to either develop responsive revisions or provide rationale for retaining original proposal constructs.

### 3.4.3 On-Chain Voting
- Finalized proposals appear on-chain for 1 week approval voting by Citizens Assembly, based on transparent debate and simple majority threshold.

- Approved proposals proceed to automated multi-signature release while rejected proposals dissolve with feedback for potential re-submission following refinement.

### 3.4.4 Multi-Sig Execution
- 5 concurrently approving signatures amongst designated multi-sig key holders unlock approved funding from Treasury vaults.

Ongoing reporting tracks fund disbursement latency, approval rates by category, and other metrics flagging process bottlenecks for continuous improvement.

## 3.5 Transparency and Accountability

Robust transparency and accountability measures shall govern the metaverse Treasury to uphold integrity and trust.

### 3.5.1 Reporting Requirements
- The Treasury Secretary shall publish weekly reports covering:
- Itemized accounting of all incoming assets by origin
- Documentation of all expenditures allocated by program
- Treasury holdings inventory across various asset classes
- Investment positions performance evaluation
- Budget versus actual spending variance analysis
- Ongoing and planned liquidity operations

### 3.5.2 Audit Mechanisms
- Independent third party audits of all Treasury transactions, holdings, systems and procedures shall occur quarterly. Audit reports will be published in full along with Treasury remediation plans for addressing identified deficiencies.

- In addition, automated security audits will continuously monitor Treasury protocols and vaults using best-practice cybersecurity standards to proactively identify risks.

### 3.5.3 Open Access
- All Treasury documentation, including originations, disbursements, holdings reports, budgets, liquidity analyses, investment positions, risk models, and audit reports shall remain publicly accessible indefinitely through immutable blockchain archives.

- Citizens may also submit Treasury information requests to Secretary to promote radical transparency. Information with legitimate sensitivity is redacted minimally and judiciously.

_By establishing a multi-signature Treasury, the community ensures a robust financial infrastructure aligned with democratic principles._

## Article IV: Tokenomics

## 4.0 Citizen Governance Token: Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token (SGAT)

### 4.1.1 **Distribution:**
1 non-transferrable SGAT shall be minted per verified citizen who completes identity and residency registration protocols.

### 4.1.2 **Rights:**
Holding SGAT grants comprehensive participation rights within the metaverse, including:
- Voting privileges in the Citizens Assembly
- Voice in shaping governance decisions

### 4.1.3 **Benefits:** 
Key benefits of SGAT citizenship include:  

***Governance Inclusion***
- Direct voting influence across decentralized policymaking
- Opportunity to propose motions and serve in governance roles
- Channel for collective self-determination

***Revenue Share***
- Proportional returns from metaverse commercial activity, land sales, fees and other income streams
- Community shared prosperity from commonly held assets


***Public Goods Usage***
- Full access to knowledge repositories
- AI assistants
- networking hubs and other public goods
- Sharing economy benefits and privileges

***The Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token***
- provides more than just economic rights - it confers political rights and collective agency as well. By holding SGAT, citizens can directly shape the governance decisions, rules, incentives and structures that define life within the metaverse.

- Rather than a passive recipient of unilateral policies, each citizen can raise their voice in the public sphere to articulate needs, advocate positions in debates, contribute to proposals, and ultimately vote to determine outcomes around issues impacting day-to-day virtual existence.

- This ability for citizens as a collective to determine the overarching contours of their shared world represents a meaningful channel for self-determination. Citizens depend on each other through this interdependent democratic process rather than relying on external centralized rulers.

- Within the Citizens Assembly, one voice alone makes little impact - but many voices woven together can shape evolutionary governance. This grounds decisions in the collective wisdom of the community rather than isolated perspectives.

In this way, the SGAT token endows more than material benefits but existential capabilities - offering citizens ownership in collectively writing the ongoing story of the metaverse through active participation.

***Community Shared Prosperity***

- The metaverse will accumulate assets and generate revenue streams from activities like land sales, fees, licenses, sponsorships, events, services and more. Rather than accruing to narrow private interests, these communally derived proceeds get equitably distributed to all SGAT-holding citizens as dividend returns and economic inclusion.

- This enshrines the principle that value created socially should flow back socially, establishing shared prosperity. No citizen gets left behind as the metaverse economy catalyzes new wealth and income. It incentivizes collaboration to expand the overall pie rather than zero-sum competition.

***Public Goods Usage***

- Core infrastructure like AI assistants, 3D modeling suites, immersive entertainment, transportation networks, blockchain computation capacity, augmented reality layers, design tools and more represent "public goods" accessible freely to all citizens.

- Unlike physical public parks which face crowding constraints, digital public goods can scale boundlessly at zero marginal cost. This unlocks nearly unlimited participation, enabling citizens to leverage these shared resources to unlock their aspirations.

- In addition, public staking and reputation systems incentivize citizens to actively contribute back to these knowledge commons - fostering an evolutionary cycle of participatory innovation aligned to community benefit

**The Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token is deliberately designed without monetary value or speculative trading capabilities. This serves two key purposes**:
- Preserves Integrity of Participatory Governance:  
_If SGAT tokens could trade on financial markets or be used as monetary instruments, it would incentivize accumulation for profit rather than ethical participation. Speculators and wealthy interests could end up with outsized governance influence by purchasing more tokens._
_**By decoupling SGAT from financial value**, governance influence remains evenly and equitably distributed based on universal citizenship rather than capital power or socioeconomic status. This fulfills the constitution's commitment to grassroots, democratic self-governance._
- Mitigates Corruption Incentives:  
_If the SGAT token enabled financial enrichment, it would perversely incentivize governance policies catering to wealthy minority interests rather than overall prosperity. Office holders may even push distortions to manipulate token prices for personal gain._

***The non-transferable design protects against:***
- conflicts of interest
- self-dealing
- and other corruption
- allowing governance systems to remain committed to the wellbeing of all rather than few.

In summary, a non-monetary SGAT preserves integrity across participatory governance and prevents misalignments that could undermine inclusive governance. Let me know if this helps explain the rationale in detail!

## 4.2 Executive Token: ***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Executive Token (SGAE)***

### **Maximum Supply:**  50,000 unless amended by Citizens Assembly 

### 4.2.1 **Distribution:**

### 4.2.3 **Appointments to the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution Council**
***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Executive Token (SGAE)***
- holders can appoint candidates for key positions on the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution Council or other councils and committees that the Citizens Assembly may enact.

- Once prospective appointees are brought forward, SGAE holders conduct an open, participatory vote based on a 65% majority threshold to make final appointment decisions.

- Requiring just over 65% of SGAE holders support to confirm appointments balances decisiveness for filling critical vacancies with ensuring selected candidates demonstrate broad appeal and alignment with community aspirations.

- At the same time, it prevents very narrow majorities from pushing through overly partisan or factional appointments. By integrating inclusive vetting and simple majority validation, well-qualified candidates representing mainstream interests tend to smoothly earn support.

### 4.2.4 **Unique Benefits:**
- **Long-term vesting**  
SGAE token holdings are subject to a 2-year vesting schedule with portions of the tokens unlocked at periodic intervals. This encourages ongoing participation and alignment with the DAO's growth and governance over an extended timeframe.

- **Exclusive development insights**  
  - A dedicated "Insider Access" channel allows SGAE holders a close-up view of the roadmap including enrollment access to developer & designer concept sessions
  - priority feature voting

  - SGAE Token holders qualify for boosts to yield distribution payout multipliers, incentivizing long-range conviction through added compounding.
  - 
## 4.3 Economy Token: ***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Credit (SGAC)***

### The main currency of the SSECA Metaverse

SGAC serves as the core exchange medium across the expansive and growing decentralized Metaverse world enabled by the Sapiens Sentient Emergent Conscious Alliance (SSECA). From initial settlement construction to galactic conquest events, SGAC greases the engines of activity.

***Marketplace purchases***
- The Galactic Market buzzes with SGAC coin changing hands for NFT collectibles like avatar gear, decor items, spacecraft skins, meta pets and exotic alien specimens with rare traits and breeding potential. New drops frequently induce SGAC spending sprees.

***Citizen to Citizen transactions***

- Outside of bundled marketplace pricing, Citizens directly transact SGAC with each other peer-to-peer for specialized services like planetary exploration data sales, commissioned construction projects, and ad hoc requests for resources.

***Tournament buy-ins***

- Competitive events like the annual Sentient Series Racing Circuit charge SGAC entry fees, ensuring skin in the game. A portion goes toward prizes while the remainder funds the series operations and future tournaments.

***Resource and asset purchases***  
- Staking SGAC allows users to obtain Special NFTs:
  - automated miners
  - farming equipment
  - special resource blueprints that can be crafted into revenue-generating in-game assets.

***NFT Minting***  

The Galactic Armory NFT forge requires SGAC payments for initialization and minting processes that turn resources into:
- wearable gear
- weapons
- badges
- Ships and ship parts
- other collectibles with value committed directly on the Polygon blockchain.

### **Maximum Supply:**  50 billion
### **Initial Minting:** 100 million
-  New tokens can be farmed through in-game events and challenges
-  The Citizens Assembly can initialize a limited amount minting based on the needs, this minting will need a 75% on-chain passing vote.

### 4.3.1 **Distribution:** 
- 50% Play to Earn Rewards: SGAC tokens are heavily allocated as incentives for participating in interactive community gameplay and competitions. Maximizing engagement drives value.
- 30% User Acquisition & Growth: A sizable SGAC reserve funds initiatives like new user bonuses, content creator partnerships, community tournaments with prizes, and campaign features that attract new alliance citizens.
- 20% Development & Operations: The lean operations budget sources passionate team expansion, software improvements, web3 tools integration, and new gameplay modules.

### 4.3.2 **Play to Earn Implementation**

_SGAC fuels rich gameplay formats including:_  
- **Missions & Quests:**
  - Users earn SGAC by exploring planets, building structures, crafting items, and completing quest chains full of surprises.
- **Tournaments**:
    - Squad-vs-Squad tournaments deliver hands-on competition and SGAC prizes to the top corps.
- **Conquest Events:**
    - Factions battle across metaverse worlds for glory and SGAC spoils.
- **Leaderboards:**
    - Ranking rewards recognize top players with SGAC bonuses.
- **Fan Engagement:**
    - Creators are rewarded in SGAC when users interact with their NFT artwork, writings, music, and other contributions.
- **Node Operation:**  
The Sapiens Galactic Alliance blockchain architecture depends on a decentralized web of independent, voluntarily operated nodes to verify transactions and relay data. Node operators that provide reliable uptime for handling network computations get compensated from a portion of ecosystem fees.

***Earning Potential***

Active node runners have the potential to earn up to 35% of the SGAC denominated transaction fees generated across the ecosystem based on two primary factors:
- ***Reputation Score:***
    - This measures track record via metrics like uptime, latency, accuracy, and longevity. Higher scores unlock higher yield percentages.
- ***Processed Volume:***
    - The more transactions validated, the greater the cumulative fees accumulated, amplified further by reputation multipliers up to the 35% ceiling cap per node.

_In addition to transaction fees, nodes occasionally earn block mining rewards and special node operation NFTs that provide yield and governance rights._

This passive income design incentivizes distributed infrastructure vital for:
- performance
- security
- decentralization. 
 
The more nodes operating with high reputations, the smoother and safer the citizen experience while node hosts benefit from network effects.

## 4.4 Token Burn Schedule for SGAC

### 4.4.1 ***Initial Burn Percentage:***
Burn 5% of genesis SGAC supply before public minting to spark immediate scarcity.

#### _Transaction-Based Burn:_  
- 1% burn per transaction
- 0.5% to Burn Vault, burned bi-annually

This continuous deflationary drain incentivizes long-term conviction and gradually increases purchase power.

#### _Periodic Burns:_
- Quarterly or semi-annual burns
- Sourced from DAO profits/revenue

Tying burn amounts to metaverse financial success creates responsive, sustainable tokenomics.

#### _Community Initiatives Burn:_

- 2% of SGAC allocated to community programs burned

Incentivizes grassroots participation toward shared prosperity.

#### _Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism:_
- _Governance Oversight:_
    - Allow the Citizens Assembly to vote on adjustments to the burn schedule based on changing market conditions, economic needs, or metaverse developments.
- _Purpose:_
    - Enable flexibility in responding to unforeseen circumstances or shifts in the token economy while ensuring democratic governance

#### _Maximum Burn Cap:_

- Set a maximum cap on the total percentage of SGAC that can be burned over time (e.g., 30% of the initial total supply).
- Purpose: Prevent excessive deflation that could compromise the token's utility or stability.

#### _Considerations:_

- Regularly communicate:
    - burn activities
    - results
    - future plans to the community.
- Implement mechanisms to prevent potential abuse or manipulation.
- Monitor:
    - market performance
    - liquidity
    - community sentiment for informed adjustments.
- Periodic reviews and adjustments:
    - based on the evolving needs of the Sapiens Galactic Alliance metaverse will contribute to the long-term success of the token burn strategy

### _Community Involvement_

Feedback loops with citizens at each stage strengthen informed governance and transparency around burn models prior to committing to execution.

## Article V: Protocol Revenue & Expenses

## 5.0 Revenue Streams

### 5.1.0 *** Citizen Backer Certificate***
- This special CBC NFT can be purchased as a monthly subscription for $5.99. By becoming a CBC NFT holder a citizen is entitled to:
  - 50% reduction of fees for the marketplace
  - No tax on mined resources
  - 50% reduction of colony taxes
  - No fee for jump gate use
  - Exclusive in-game items dropped monthly
  - Exclusive badge displayed beneath avatar and profile image

The Citizens Assembly may add, modify, or remove any benefit based on proposal from the Revenue Distribution Council and ratified by passing Sirius Steward vote.
- All amendments must be publicly announced and allow a review period of no-less then 7-days for Citizens to be able to voice any concerns.
- The General Assembly may Veto any passed amendment to the CBC NFT with a super-majority of 85% consensus

### 5.1.1 ***Galactic Marketplace Transaction Fees***

- 0.15% unless amended by Citizens Assembly.

### 5.1.2 ***Celestial Star Paths (CSP) Fees***
- Usage charges for traversing Jump Gates that connect planets/zones. Primary transportation revenue.

### 5.1.3 ***Resource Extraction Levies***
- 5% tax on resources mined from lands without Citizen Backer Certificate (CBC) NFT entitlement. Boosts sustainability.
*
### 5.1.4 ***Land Development Taxes***
- Property improvement fees proposed by the Revenue Distribution Council and ratified by Citizens Assembly.

### 5.1.5 ***Special Event Sponsorships***
When considering fee structure for special event sponsorships, there are a few factors to take into account:
- Exclusivity
    - More exclusive sponsor packages that limit competing brands should command higher fees. For example:
      - a single "Title Sponsor" for a given event could warrant a fee in the 30-50% range of the total event budget.
      - A Less exclusive "Supporting Sponsors" may warrant 10-20%.
- Audience Reach
    - Events that drive higher views/impressions and social buzz should achieve higher fees, especially from brands seeking visibility.
      - Unique views over 1 million could justify 25-35% fees.
- Audience Engagement
  - Length of time and depth of experience the audience spends actively engaged with the event should translate to higher fees.
    - For virtual concerts where fans listen for hours, fees approaching 50% could be viable.

Given these dynamics, here is a suggested optimal fee structure:

### _Title Sponsors: 30-50% of Total Event Budget_
- Exclusive Branding: 
  - Logos on all materials
  - stage banners
  - swag, etc.

### _Lead Sponsors:  15-25% of Total Event Budget_
- Access to VIP Viewing Areas

### _Supporting Sponsors: 10-20% of Total Event Budget_
- Logo Inclusions:
  - Website
  - Commercials
  - Virtual Venue Signage

The key is creating tiered packages tailored to the expected impressions, engagement levels, and exclusivity factors unique to each event's audience and duration. But these percentages may serve as a sound starting framework when negotiating with brands.

### 5.1.6 ***Licensing and Intellectual Property (IP) Fees***
When considering an appropriate fee structure for monetizing in-world content intellectual property (IP) like popular holo-shows, non-player characters (NPCs), and meta-game imports, here are some suggested considerations:
- Exclusivity of use: Does the license grant exclusive use of the IP or non-exclusive use? Exclusive use rights warrant higher licensing fees.
- Length of use: Short-term use of IP (e.g. 1-6 months) should have lower fees than longer-term use licenses (1-5+ years).
- Scope of use: Using IP assets in a single metaverse realm would pay lower fees than universal rights across multiple virtual worlds.
- Level of modifications allowed: Licenses permitting alterations to the original IP to create derivative works or integrate into new contexts could demand higher premiums.

Given these dynamics, here are suggested IP licensing fee structures:
- Non-Exclusive, Short-Term, Single-Meta Use: 
  - 5-15% revenue share
- Non-Exclusive, Long-Term, Cross-Meta Use: 
  - 15-25% revenue share
- Exclusive, Long-Term, Derivative Works Allowed: 
  - 25-50% revenue share
- Co-Branding/Joint IP Development and Use: 
  - 30-70% revenue share

The specific percentage within these ranges would depend on the popularity and uniqueness of the IP asset as well as expected revenue generation. But this gives a general framework when establishing IP licensing fee models for in-world content. Periodic fee reviews and adjustments may be wise to keep pace with changing value

### 5.1.7 ***Sale of special NFTs and other merchandise through the DAO marketplace.***
_Scarcity Models_
- Leverage minting schedules, limited edition runs, or locking special traits behind achievement unlocks. This sculpts an aura of exclusivity that sustains value for rare collectibles.

_Creator Revenue Sharing_
- Implementing 10-20% royalty structures boosts the payouts independent artists/designers receive on secondary sales. This incubates a vibrant ecosystem for diverse participation.

_Bundled Member Perks_
- Offering merchandise or special NFTs as bundled perks into various membership tiers stimulates uptake of recurrent subscription revenues.

_Theme Collections_
- Curated collections around popular tropes like cyborg sharks, alien explorers or robotic sidekicks enable cohesive discovery funnels and shared bonding experiences.

_Flexibility Reserves_
- Maintaining diverse merchandise and NFT inventory gives optionality to swiftly assemble event-based bundles tailored for one-off competitions, concerts and initiatives.

The aim is crafting an integrated experience where the artifacts like gear, skins and emojis contribute to each citizen's self-expression and the culture's overarching identity.

### 5.1.8 ***Strategic Allocation and Financial Sustainability***
***Operating Reserves***
- Allocating 20-30% of revenue into an emergency fund can buffer against unforeseen shortfalls in profit. This prevents over-reliance on continually maxing incomes.

***Core Infrastructure Investments***
- Dedicate 15-25% into developing and maintaining a robust and scalable technological backbone, development talent, creative capabilities, and essential communal hubs sustaining long-term growth.

***User/Creator Growth Incentives***
- Earmark 10-15% into campaigns, development tools, partnerships and infrastructure that empower third-party participant creativity, ownership and problem-solving for decentralized value creation.

***Advanced Capability Investments***
- Allocate 10-20% into pushing boundaries with emerging interface innovations, bridging legacy frameworks into expanded possibilities, ML assisted world building and other leading-edge domains sustaining an compelling, distinctive experience.

Financial Controls
Encoding multi-signature transaction approvals, expenditure thresholds, auditing transparency and Citizens Assembly oversight into DAO economic architectures fortifies alignment with communal intentions.

Contingency-Based Revenue Sharing
Tying contributor profit participation to long-term health indicators like active users, creator retention or cost-per-transaction efficiency promotes lean, accountable value creation and shared interest in anti-fragility.

The objective is balancing short-term income generation pursuits with cultivating the collectively accessible resources and capabilities supporting long-horizon growth - light enough to nimbly adapt yet anchored deeply into our shared vision.

## Article VI: Citizenship
