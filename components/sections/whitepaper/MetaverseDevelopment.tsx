            Continuous development will include regular updates to enhance
            gameplay features, ensuring a dynamic and evolving gaming
            environment. All new and updated features will be spearheaded by

            development. Each new feature/update can be presented to the
            Tribunal to be called to community vote. All new features and
            non-security updates will be presented to the community for a vote
            to be implemented, the priority of implementation will be based on
            the number of votes. Any new feature must obtain a minimum of 60% of
            the votes to be implemented. New non-security updates to existing
            features only need a simple majority to be implemented.
