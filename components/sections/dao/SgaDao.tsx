                oversight, ensuring fair resolutions to conflicts. The Assembly
                shall elect the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution
                Committee, and shall ratify the Constitution. The Assembly shall

                The Tribunal is required by charter to assemble every 8 weeks
                for regular meetings to review pending cases and complaints
                against citizens and colonies. Sessions involve fact-finding,
                testimony from involved parties, deliberation and finally
