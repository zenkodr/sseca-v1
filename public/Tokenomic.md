# SSECA & SGA DAO Tokenomics - V1.0
### _Created on the 23 day of OCtober 2023_

### Citizen Governance Token: Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token (SGAT)

### **Distribution:**
1 non-transferrable SGAT shall be minted per verified citizen who completes identity and residency registration protocols.

### **Rights:**
Holding SGAT grants comprehensive participation rights within the metaverse, including:
- Voting privileges in the Citizens Assembly
- Voice in shaping governance decisions

### **Benefits:** 
Key benefits of SGAT citizenship include:  

***Governance Inclusion***
- Direct voting influence across decentralized policymaking
- Opportunity to propose motions and serve in governance roles
- Channel for collective self-determination

***Revenue Share***
- Proportional returns from metaverse commercial activity, land sales, fees and other income streams
- Community shared prosperity from commonly held assets


***Public Goods Usage***
- Full access to knowledge repositories
- AI assistants
- networking hubs and other public goods
- Sharing economy benefits and privileges

***The Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token***
- provides more than just economic rights - it confers political rights and collective agency as well. By holding SGAT, citizens can directly shape the governance decisions, rules, incentives and structures that define life within the metaverse.

- Rather than a passive recipient of unilateral policies, each citizen can raise their voice in the public sphere to articulate needs, advocate positions in debates, contribute to proposals, and ultimately vote to determine outcomes around issues impacting day-to-day virtual existence.

- This ability for citizens as a collective to determine the overarching contours of their shared world represents a meaningful channel for self-determination. Citizens depend on each other through this interdependent democratic process rather than relying on external centralized rulers.

- Within the Citizens Assembly, one voice alone makes little impact - but many voices woven together can shape evolutionary governance. This grounds decisions in the collective wisdom of the community rather than isolated perspectives.

In this way, the SGAT token endows more than material benefits but existential capabilities - offering citizens ownership in collectively writing the ongoing story of the metaverse through active participation.

***Community Shared Prosperity***

- The metaverse will accumulate assets and generate revenue streams from activities like land sales, fees, licenses, sponsorships, events, services and more. Rather than accruing to narrow private interests, these communally derived proceeds get equitably distributed to all SGAT-holding citizens as dividend returns and economic inclusion.

- This enshrines the principle that value created socially should flow back socially, establishing shared prosperity. No citizen gets left behind as the metaverse economy catalyzes new wealth and income. It incentivizes collaboration to expand the overall pie rather than zero-sum competition.

***Public Goods Usage***

- Core infrastructure like AI assistants, 3D modeling suites, immersive entertainment, transportation networks, blockchain computation capacity, augmented reality layers, design tools and more represent "public goods" accessible freely to all citizens.

- Unlike physical public parks which face crowding constraints, digital public goods can scale boundlessly at zero marginal cost. This unlocks nearly unlimited participation, enabling citizens to leverage these shared resources to unlock their aspirations.

- In addition, public staking and reputation systems incentivize citizens to actively contribute back to these knowledge commons - fostering an evolutionary cycle of participatory innovation aligned to community benefit

**The Sapiens Galactic Alliance Token is deliberately designed without monetary value or speculative trading capabilities. This serves two key purposes**:
- Preserves Integrity of Participatory Governance:  
_If SGAT tokens could trade on financial markets or be used as monetary instruments, it would incentivize accumulation for profit rather than ethical participation. Speculators and wealthy interests could end up with outsized governance influence by purchasing more tokens._
_**By decoupling SGAT from financial value**, governance influence remains evenly and equitably distributed based on universal citizenship rather than capital power or socioeconomic status. This fulfills the constitution's commitment to grassroots, democratic self-governance._
- Mitigates Corruption Incentives:  
_If the SGAT token enabled financial enrichment, it would perversely incentivize governance policies catering to wealthy minority interests rather than overall prosperity. Office holders may even push distortions to manipulate token prices for personal gain._

***The non-transferable design protects against:***
- conflicts of interest
- self-dealing
- and other corruption
- allowing governance systems to remain committed to the wellbeing of all rather than few.

In summary, a non-monetary SGAT preserves integrity across participatory governance and prevents misalignments that could undermine inclusive governance. Let me know if this helps explain the rationale in detail!

## Executive Token: ***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Executive Token (SGAE)***

### **Maximum Supply:**  50,000 unless amended by Citizens Assembly 

### **Distribution:**
- 20% Founding Team
- 10% Advisors & Partners
- 30% Community Reserves
- 40% Public Sale.

### **Unique Rights:**
- Protocol Governance Influence
- Veto initiation with-in the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution Council proposals
  - must have 75% consensus of SGAE holders
  - 51% consensus of the Citizens Assembly for veto to pass.
- Priority Access to New Features.
- SGAE Tokens can only be owned by Verified Citizens

### **Appointments to the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution Council**
***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Executive Token (SGAE)***
- holders can appoint candidates for key positions on the Galactic Tribunal and Revenue Distribution Council or other councils and committees that the Citizens Assembly may enact.

- Once prospective appointees are brought forward, SGAE holders conduct an open, participatory vote based on a 65% majority threshold to make final appointment decisions.

- Requiring just over 65% of SGAE holders support to confirm appointments balances decisiveness for filling critical vacancies with ensuring selected candidates demonstrate broad appeal and alignment with community aspirations.

- At the same time, it prevents very narrow majorities from pushing through overly partisan or factional appointments. By integrating inclusive vetting and simple majority validation, well-qualified candidates representing mainstream interests tend to smoothly earn support.

### **Unique Benefits:**
- **Long-term vesting**  
SGAE token holdings are subject to a 2-year vesting schedule with portions of the tokens unlocked at periodic intervals. This encourages ongoing participation and alignment with the DAO's growth and governance over an extended timeframe.

- **Exclusive development insights**  
  - A dedicated "Insider Access" channel allows SGAE holders a close-up view of the roadmap including enrollment access to developer & designer concept sessions
  - priority feature voting
  - first looks at UI/UX mockups  

  This high-touch involvement fuels vision-building.

- **Personalized recognition in the Metaverse**
  - Every SGAE holder receives a Founders Pass:  
  a prestigious digital token minted as an NFT on the Polygon blockchain. This rare artifact unlocks an exclusive founder statue guardian in the Galactic Stronghold hub recognizing their early commitment to the alliance
  - priority access passes to future Metaverse chapter house openings.

- **Early NFT access**  
  - The Galactic Armory and Galactic Archives NFT collections grant SGAE holders 72 hour exclusive early access windows for new seasonal releases and special edition drops
  - Priority-queue eligibility enables first picks at inventory.

- **Annual dividends**
  - Revenue Distribution Council maps out an annual treasury yield schedule paid in SGAT alliance governance tokens. Payouts come from performing treasury assets and ecosystem service fees
  - SGAE Token holders qualify for boosts to yield distribution payout multipliers, incentivizing long-range conviction through added compounding.
  - 
## Economy Token: ***Sapiens Galactic Alliance Credit (SGAC)***

### The main currency of the SSECA Metaverse

SGAC serves as the core exchange medium across the expansive and growing decentralized Metaverse world enabled by the Sapiens Sentient Emergent Conscious Alliance (SSECA). From initial settlement construction to galactic conquest events, SGAC greases the engines of activity.

***Marketplace purchases***
- The Galactic Market buzzes with SGAC coin changing hands for NFT collectibles like avatar gear, decor items, spacecraft skins, meta pets and exotic alien specimens with rare traits and breeding potential. New drops frequently induce SGAC spending sprees.

***Citizen to Citizen transactions***

- Outside of bundled marketplace pricing, Citizens directly transact SGAC with each other peer-to-peer for specialized services like planetary exploration data sales, commissioned construction projects, and ad hoc requests for resources.

***Tournament buy-ins***

- Competitive events like the annual Sentient Series Racing Circuit charge SGAC entry fees, ensuring skin in the game. A portion goes toward prizes while the remainder funds the series operations and future tournaments.

***Resource and asset purchases***  
- Staking SGAC allows users to obtain Special NFTs:
  - automated miners
  - farming equipment
  - special resource blueprints that can be crafted into revenue-generating in-game assets.

***NFT Minting***  

The Galactic Armory NFT forge requires SGAC payments for initialization and minting processes that turn resources into:
- wearable gear
- weapons
- badges
- Ships and ship parts
- other collectibles with value committed directly on the Polygon blockchain.

### **Maximum Supply:**  50 billion
### **Initial Minting:** 100 million
-  New tokens can be farmed through in-game events and challenges
-  The Citizens Assembly can initialize a limited amount minting based on the needs, this minting will need a 75% on-chain passing vote.

### **Distribution:** 
- 50% Play to Earn Rewards: SGAC tokens are heavily allocated as incentives for participating in interactive community gameplay and competitions. Maximizing engagement drives value.
- 30% User Acquisition & Growth: A sizable SGAC reserve funds initiatives like new user bonuses, content creator partnerships, community tournaments with prizes, and campaign features that attract new alliance citizens.
- 20% Development & Operations: The lean operations budget sources passionate team expansion, software improvements, web3 tools integration, and new gameplay modules.

### **Play to Earn Implementation**

_SGAC fuels rich gameplay formats including:_  
- **Missions & Quests:**
  - Users earn SGAC by exploring planets, building structures, crafting items, and completing quest chains full of surprises.
- **Tournaments**:
    - Squad-vs-Squad tournaments deliver hands-on competition and SGAC prizes to the top corps.
- **Conquest Events:**
    - Factions battle across metaverse worlds for glory and SGAC spoils.
- **Leaderboards:**
    - Ranking rewards recognize top players with SGAC bonuses.
- **Fan Engagement:**
    - Creators are rewarded in SGAC when users interact with their NFT artwork, writings, music, and other contributions.
- **Node Operation:**  
The Sapiens Galactic Alliance blockchain architecture depends on a decentralized web of independent, voluntarily operated nodes to verify transactions and relay data. Node operators that provide reliable uptime for handling network computations get compensated from a portion of ecosystem fees.

***Earning Potential***

Active node runners have the potential to earn up to 35% of the SGAC denominated transaction fees generated across the ecosystem based on two primary factors:
- ***Reputation Score:***
    - This measures track record via metrics like uptime, latency, accuracy, and longevity. Higher scores unlock higher yield percentages.
- ***Processed Volume:***
    - The more transactions validated, the greater the cumulative fees accumulated, amplified further by reputation multipliers up to the 35% ceiling cap per node.

_In addition to transaction fees, nodes occasionally earn block mining rewards and special node operation NFTs that provide yield and governance rights._

This passive income design incentivizes distributed infrastructure vital for:
- performance
- security
- decentralization. 
 
The more nodes operating with high reputations, the smoother and safer the citizen experience while node hosts benefit from network effects.

## Token Burn Schedule for SGAC

### ***Initial Burn Percentage:***
Burn 5% of genesis SGAC supply before public minting to spark immediate scarcity.

#### _Transaction-Based Burn:_  
- 1% burn per transaction
- 0.5% to Burn Vault, burned bi-annually

This continuous deflationary drain incentivizes long-term conviction and gradually increases purchase power.

#### _Periodic Burns:_
- Quarterly or semi-annual burns
- Sourced from DAO profits/revenue

Tying burn amounts to metaverse financial success creates responsive, sustainable tokenomics.

#### _Community Initiatives Burn:_

- 2% of SGAC allocated to community programs burned

Incentivizes grassroots participation toward shared prosperity.

#### _Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism:_
- _Governance Oversight:_
    - Allow the Citizens Assembly to vote on adjustments to the burn schedule based on changing market conditions, economic needs, or metaverse developments.
- _Purpose:_
    - Enable flexibility in responding to unforeseen circumstances or shifts in the token economy while ensuring democratic governance

#### _Maximum Burn Cap:_

- Set a maximum cap on the total percentage of SGAC that can be burned over time (e.g., 30% of the initial total supply).
- Purpose: Prevent excessive deflation that could compromise the token's utility or stability.

#### _Considerations:_

- Regularly communicate:
    - burn activities
    - results
    - future plans to the community.
- Implement mechanisms to prevent potential abuse or manipulation.
- Monitor:
    - market performance
    - liquidity
    - community sentiment for informed adjustments.
- Periodic reviews and adjustments:
    - based on the evolving needs of the Sapiens Galactic Alliance metaverse will contribute to the long-term success of the token burn strategy

### _Community Involvement_

Feedback loops with citizens at each stage strengthen informed governance and transparency around burn models prior to committing to execution.

## Article V: Protocol Revenue & Financial Stability

## Revenue Streams

### *** Citizen Backer Certificate***

*
### 5.1.4 ***Land Development Taxes***
- Property improvement fees proposed by the Revenue Distribution Council and ratified by Citizens Assembly.

### 5.1.5 ***Special Event Sponsorships***
When considering fee structure for special event sponsorships, there are a few factors to take into account:
- Exclusivity
    - More exclusive sponsor packages that limit competing brands should command higher fees. For example:
      - a single "Title Sponsor" for a given event could warrant a fee in the 30-50% range of the total event budget.
      - A Less exclusive "Supporting Sponsors" may warrant 10-20%.
- Audience Reach
    - Events that drive higher views/impressions and social buzz should achieve higher fees, especially from brands seeking visibility.
      - Unique views over 1 million could justify 25-35% fees.
- Audience Engagement
  - Length of time and depth of experience the audience spends actively engaged with the event should translate to higher fees.
    - For virtual concerts where fans listen for hours, fees approaching 50% could be viable.

Given these dynamics, here is a suggested optimal fee structure:

### _Title Sponsors: 30-50% of Total Event Budget_
- Exclusive Branding: 
  - Logos on all materials
  - stage banners
  - swag, etc.

### _Lead Sponsors:  15-25% of Total Event Budget_
- Access to VIP Viewing Areas

### _Supporting Sponsors: 10-20% of Total Event Budget_
- Logo Inclusions:
  - Website
  - Commercials
  - Virtual Venue Signage

The key is creating tiered packages tailored to the expected impressions, engagement levels, and exclusivity factors unique to each event's audience and duration. But these percentages may serve as a sound starting framework when negotiating with brands.

### 5.1.6 ***Licensing and Intellectual Property (IP) Fees***
When considering an appropriate fee structure for monetizing in-world content intellectual property (IP) like popular holo-shows, non-player characters (NPCs), and meta-game imports, here are some suggested considerations:
- Exclusivity of use: Does the license grant exclusive use of the IP or non-exclusive use? Exclusive use rights warrant higher licensing fees.
- Length of use: Short-term use of IP (e.g. 1-6 months) should have lower fees than longer-term use licenses (1-5+ years).
- Scope of use: Using IP assets in a single metaverse realm would pay lower fees than universal rights across multiple virtual worlds.
- Level of modifications allowed: Licenses permitting alterations to the original IP to create derivative works or integrate into new contexts could demand higher premiums.

Given these dynamics, here are suggested IP licensing fee structures:
- Non-Exclusive, Short-Term, Single-Meta Use: 
  - 5-15% revenue share
- Non-Exclusive, Long-Term, Cross-Meta Use: 
  - 15-25% revenue share
- Exclusive, Long-Term, Derivative Works Allowed: 
  - 25-50% revenue share
- Co-Branding/Joint IP Development and Use: 
  - 30-70% revenue share

The specific percentage within these ranges would depend on the popularity and uniqueness of the IP asset as well as expected revenue generation. But this gives a general framework when establishing IP licensing fee models for in-world content. Periodic fee reviews and adjustments may be wise to keep pace with changing value

### ***Sale of special NFTs and other merchandise through the DAO marketplace.***
_Scarcity Models_
- Leverage minting schedules, limited edition runs, or locking special traits behind achievement unlocks. This sculpts an aura of exclusivity that sustains value for rare collectibles.

_Creator Revenue Sharing_
- Implementing 10-20% royalty structures boosts the payouts independent artists/designers receive on secondary sales. This incubates a vibrant ecosystem for diverse participation.

_Bundled Member Perks_
- Offering merchandise or special NFTs as bundled perks into various membership tiers stimulates uptake of recurrent subscription revenues.

_Theme Collections_
- Curated collections around popular tropes like cyborg sharks, alien explorers or robotic sidekicks enable cohesive discovery funnels and shared bonding experiences.

_Flexibility Reserves_
- Maintaining diverse merchandise and NFT inventory gives optionality to swiftly assemble event-based bundles tailored for one-off competitions, concerts and initiatives.

The aim is crafting an integrated experience where the artifacts like gear, skins and emojis contribute to each citizen's self-expression and the culture's overarching identity.

### ***Strategic Allocation and Financial Sustainability***
***Operating Reserves***
- Allocating 20-30% of revenue into an emergency fund can buffer against unforeseen shortfalls in profit. This prevents over-reliance on continually maxing incomes.

***Core Infrastructure Investments***
- Dedicate 15-25% into developing and maintaining a robust and scalable technological backbone, development talent, creative capabilities, and essential communal hubs sustaining long-term growth.

***User/Creator Growth Incentives***
- Earmark 10-15% into campaigns, development tools, partnerships and infrastructure that empower third-party participant creativity, ownership and problem-solving for decentralized value creation.

***Advanced Capability Investments***
- Allocate 10-20% into pushing boundaries with emerging interface innovations, bridging legacy frameworks into expanded possibilities, ML assisted world building and other leading-edge domains sustaining an compelling, distinctive experience.

Financial Controls
Encoding multi-signature transaction approvals, expenditure thresholds, auditing transparency and Citizens Assembly oversight into DAO economic architectures fortifies alignment with communal intentions.

Contingency-Based Revenue Sharing
Tying contributor profit participation to long-term health indicators like active users, creator retention or cost-per-transaction efficiency promotes lean, accountable value creation and shared interest in anti-fragility.

The objective is balancing short-term income generation pursuits with cultivating the collectively accessible resources and capabilities supporting long-horizon growth - light enough to nimbly adapt yet anchored deeply into our shared vision.
